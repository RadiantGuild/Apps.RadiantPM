> This repository is for the rewrite of RadiantPM. For the original version, please see [here](https://gitlab.com/radiant-guild-oss/radiantpm).



**NOTE:** RadiantPM isn't stable yet, we don't recommend you use it in production.



## What is RadiantPM?

- Self-hosted - keep total control of your packages

- Extremely customisable - use plugins to tailor to your use case

## What isn't RadiantPM

- Stable - although we use it at the Radiant Guild, we don't recommend you use it in production

- Simple or zero-config - you will have to do a decent amount of setup of plugins, configuration, docker images, and some code

- A package proxy - by default RadiantPM will only serve packages that it directly hosts

## Setup

RadiantPM can't be deployed for production yet, but watch this space, it is coming soon!

For now, you can look at the [Local storage / Github auth](./examples/local-github) example to see how you can run it locally.

## More Info

Some of the documentation is currently quite outdated as most of the effort has been put into getting RadiantPM into a functioning state. If you want to read it anyway, you can look in the docs directory, or the readme files of some of the packages.

As docs get updated, they will be put into a list below.
